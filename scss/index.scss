/* Note to future me.
Make sure you comment what each css class does so you can look back while making future projects. Should also make it easier to refine of you find a better way of doing something. Also create template pages for html so you don't have to recreate everything every single time you make a new page. That would suck, so just make the templates, and we all good. */
