<p>The Empire of Sersh was founded in 0 SS by the great Human warrior, Liet Sersh, along with the Sershan Standard calendar. Founded from the remains of the ancient United Cities of South Kharzim. Sometime between 38 SC and 41 SC, they had managed to unite the old cities once more. All was well, until Liet Sersh passed from old age. His right hand assumed leadership of Sersha, and took the former leader's name as a title. With this new title and leadership, Liet Handen became more aggressive with his new military, and started claiming more land for the Empire of Sersh. Due to the increase of military, rumors started forming around the legitimacy of Handen's leadership, and how he came to power. Many assumed that he stood over Sersh and drove a blade through him. Others assumed he poisoned one of his drinks. Many people had gained a lot of distrust in Handen, and some even started to rebel against him. A large rebellion group formed, and they called themselves "The Sershan Empire." This group was rising in popularity, and people believed that they were the true leaders of the nation. A giant earthquake hit the nation, causing the room that Liet Handen was into crumble, crushing him with giant boulders that had built up the walls. After the quake, his body was discovered, and the leader of The Sershan Empire assumed leadership of the nation.</p><br>
<p>After the quakes, everything went quiet. Barely anyone went outside, for fear that a stone building or a large tree would fall and crush them. What the nation needed right now was a leader who cared about the people. Not a leader who uses the entire military force to conquer new lands. Liet Marchael was exactly that. His entire reign consisted of giving the people what they needed, rather than expanding the empire. He had always believed that a strong empire required a strong population. He also started forming a proper governing system, and a better way of choosing new leaders. He eventually stood down as Liet in 83 SS.</p><br>
<p>With an empire that was stronger than ever before, the new newly elected Liet Lefin started distributing his military around the Sershan border, and slowly pushed out, bringing new land into the empire - whether by force or influence. Lefin's reign bought the empire to see it's 100-year anniversary of being founded. To celebrate this, he ran a celebratory festival in Sersha's capital, Mondhol. This festival included a giant feast at the end of the week, where he was poisoned, and met his untimely demise.</p><br>
<p>Two years passed, and the nation was in complete chaos, until the Dwarf, Moric stood up to take the role as the 5th Liet of Sersha. Moric had trained as a sorcerer for the first 100 years of his life, and had the ability to prolong his life expectency by few hundred years. Due to this, he was able to reign over Sersha for 235 years before standing down and giving the title of Liet to his son, Moric II. There were people who were outraged about not having a diplomatic vote for the next Leit, and so the rebelions started. Mra'Kin, was the leader of one of these activist groups. He was quite a popular leader in Mondhol, however not to Moric II. Mra'Kin planned an event where they would storm the Liet's house, and force him to stand down. Moric II refused to stand down, however, so Mra'Kin took things into his own hands, and killed Moric II in his sleep. In the morning, the body was found, and Mra'Kin anounced he was assuming the title of Leit. </p>
