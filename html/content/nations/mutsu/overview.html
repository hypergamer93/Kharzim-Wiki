<p>The Kingdom of Mutsu was established in 385 SS by <a href="#">Mutsu I</a>, to unite the northern coast of Westland Kharzim. Eventually, they started expanding south, until they hit water. Later on, after they started interacting with the <a href="/html/nations/sersha.html">Sershan Empire</a>, they discovered a decently sized island off the west coast, and so they started settling there in around 427 SS. In 454 SS, King Mutsu III entrusted his closest Duke, <a href="#">Gortreoza</a> to govern his own land, and formed the <a href="/html/nations/gortreoza.html">Duchy of Gortreoza</a>.</p>
<p>Currently ruled by King Mutsu IX</p>
