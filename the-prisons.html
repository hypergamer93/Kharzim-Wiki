			<h1>The Island Prisons</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The Island Prisons, also known as The Islands and The Prisons, are the highest security prisons in all of Kharzim. The Prisons were created in 52 SC, by the <a href="#">Grand Wizard, Maz'Kin</a> of <a href="#">Kildungrim</a>. These prisons are covered in runes to keep people in and out, and to ensure none of the inmates die die to starvation, dehydration, or other natural causes. These prisons are designed for the baddest of the bunch, and houses powerful magic users, and rebels who hade killed entire armies. It's fair to say that the inmates here are here for good reasoning. You wouldn't want any of them to be running around the streets.</p>
			<h2>Location</h2>
			<p>The Island Prisons are located over 100 kilometers off the shore of the Kingdom of Mutsu.</p>
